## tic-tac-toe
A two-player tic-tac-toe game.

### To play:
Open the `tictactoe.asm` file in MARS. Assemble and run the program. When prompted, enter a number 1-9 (1 being the top left corner, 9 being the bottom right corner, moving across rows) to indicate player x's move. The board will re-draw with the updated move. Enter player o's move when prompted. Repeat until someone wins or there is a tie (the game will terminate on either condition).
